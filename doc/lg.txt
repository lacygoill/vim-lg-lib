                                        *E8000*

You asked for a local motion to be  made repeatable, but at least 1 of its {lhs}
is not used in a local mapping.

                                        *E8001*

The motion  you're trying to make  repeatable (M), is already  repeatable:
total collision

Or, a motion in a database of  repeatable motions (global or local) has the same
mode as (M), the same  scope, and one of its {lhs} has the  same value as one of
(M): partial collision
