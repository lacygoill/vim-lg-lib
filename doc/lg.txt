                                        *repeatable-motion-global-local*

You can ask to make a global motion repeatable or a local one (2 possibilities).
Besides, there can be (3 possibilities):

    • a global motion    using the same 2 {lhs}

    • a local motion     "

    • a local motion     using one, and only one, identical {lhs}

          its left  {lhs} is used  in a  local mapping, and  the right one  in a
          global mapping, or the reverse

That makes 6 possible combinations. Here's what happens for each of them.
When you ask for:

    • a local motion, and it exists

              the motion is made repeatable

    • a global motion, and there's no shadowing
      local motion

              the motion is made repeatable

    • a global motion, and there's a shadowing
      local motion

            the motion is made repeatable
            the function will temporarily unshadow the global motion,
            for |maparg()| to return the information about the latter

    • a local motion, but it doesn't exist

            the function will bail out and raise |E8000| because
            it checks that both {lhs} are used in local mappings

    • a local  motion, but it only partially exists

            the function will bail out and raise |E8000| because
            it checks that both {lhs} are used in local mappings

    • a global motion, but one of its {lhs} is shadowed
      by a local motion

            the plugin will make the 2 global {lhs}
            repeatable (unshadowing one of them)

                                        *lg#motion#repeatable#main#make_repeatable()*
lg#motion#repeatable#main#make_repeatable({what})

                Make the motions described in {what} repeatable.

                {what} is a dictionary containing 5 keys:

                        mode       the mode in which the motion is defined

                        buffer     a boolean flag; when on, the motion is local
                                   to the current buffer

                        axis       dictionary with 2 keys: 'bwd' and 'fwd'

                                   the values of this dictionary are the keys
                                   which must be pressed to repeat the motion
                                   in 2 directions

                                   the dictionary may contain an optional 3rd
                                   key: 'mode';
                                   by   default,  the   function  will   install
                                   the  mappings  to  repeat  the  motion  using
                                   `:noremap`, but if 'mode'  is given the value
                                   'n', they will  be installed with `:nnoremap`
                                   instead;
                                   this  is  useful  if  the keys  may  have  an
                                   undesired effect in some mode;
                                   for example, `co,` and `co;` could be used in
                                   normal mode, but they would introduce lag
                                   for the `c` operator in visual mode

                        from       the filepath and the line address from which
                                   the function is called;

                                   you can get it programmatically with: >

                                       expand('<sfile>:p').':'.expand('<slnum>')
<
                                   you can  give any  value, including  an empty
                                   string; it will be  printed when asking for
                                   a verbose listing of the database

                        motions    a list of motions

                                   each item must be a dictionary containing
                                   2 keys:

                                       'bwd'     key to press to move backwards

                                       'fwd'     key to press to move forwards

                Example: >

                        call lg#motion#repeatable#main#make_repeatable({
                        \        'mode':   '',
                        \        'buffer': 0,
                        \        'axis':   {'bwd': ',', 'fwd': ';'},
                        \        'from':   expand('<sfile>:p').':'.expand('<slnum>'),
                        \        'motions': [
                        \                     { 'bwd': '[M',  'fwd': ']M' },
                        \                     { 'bwd': '[m',  'fwd': ']m' },
                        \                   ],
                        \ })

                                        *E8000*

The dictionary argument you passed to `lg#motion#repeatable#main#make()` should
contain the following keys:

    • 'axis'
    • 'buffer'
    • 'from'
    • 'mode'
    • 'motions'

At least one of them is missing.


                                        *E8001*

The axis that you provided should have the keys 'bwd' and 'fwd'.
At least one of them is missing.


                                        *E8002*

You asked  for a local motion  to be made  repeatable: both its {lhs}  should be
used in local mappings. But here, at least one of them is not.


                                        *E8003*

Either the motion you're trying to make repeatable (M), is already repeatable:

                               “total collision”

Or, a motion in a database of repeatable motions (global or local) has:

    • the same mode as (M)
    • the same scope as (M)
    • one of its {lhs} is identical to one of (M)

                              “partial collision”

         dictionary `[s:|b:]repeatable_motions`

         Contains the information relative to all repeatable motions.


 motion

         dictionary containing 2 keys:

                        the backward motion

             • fwd:     same thing for `<right>` as the forward motion
