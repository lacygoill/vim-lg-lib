                                        *E8000*

You asked  for a local motion  to be made  repeatable: both its {lhs}  should be
used in local mappings. But here, at least 1 of them is not.


                                        *E8001*

Either the motion you're trying to make repeatable (M), is already repeatable:

                               total collision

Or, a motion in a database of repeatable motions (global or local) has:

    • the same mode as (M)
    • the same scope as (M)
    • one of its {lhs} has the same value as one of (M)

                              partial collision
