                                        *repeatable-motion-global-local*

You can ask to make a global motion repeatable or a local one (2 possibilities).
Besides, there can be (3 possibilities):

    • a global motion    using the same 2 {lhs}

    • a local motion     "

    • a local motion     using one, and only one, identical {lhs}

          its left  {lhs} is used  in a  local mapping, and  the right one  in a
          global mapping, or the reverse

That makes 6 possible combinations. Here's what happens for each of them.
When you ask for:

    • a local motion, and it exists

              the motion is made repeatable

    • a global motion, and there's no shadowing
      local motion

              the motion is made repeatable

    • a global motion, and there's a shadowing
      local motion

            the motion is made repeatable
            the function will temporarily unshadow the global motion,
            for |maparg()| to return the information about the latter

    • a local motion, but it doesn't exist

            the function will bail out and raise |E8000| because
            it checks that both {lhs} are used in local mappings

    • a local  motion, but it only partially exists

            the function will bail out and raise |E8000| because
            it checks that both {lhs} are used in local mappings

    • a global motion, but one of its {lhs} is shadowed
      by a local motion

            the plugin will make the 2 global {lhs}
            repeatable (unshadowing one of them)

                                        *lg#motion#repeatable#main#make_repeatable()*

lg#motion#repeatable#main#make_repeatable({what})

                Make the motions described in {what} repeatable.

                {what} is a dictionary containing 4 keys:

                        mode       the mode in which the motion is defined

                        buffer     a boolean flag; when on, the motion is local
                                   to the current buffer

                        from       the filepath and the line address from which
                                   the function is called;

                                   you can get it programmatically with: >

                                       expand('<sfile>:p').':'.expand('<slnum>')
<
                                   you can  give any  value, including  an empty
                                   string; it will be  printed when asking for
                                   a verbose listing of the database

                        motions    a list of motions

                                   each item must be a dictionary containing
                                   3 keys:

                                       bwd     key to press to move backwards

                                       fwd     key to press to move forwards

                                       axis    axis on which the motion belongs
                                               determines how the motion can be
                                               repeated

                Example: >

                        call lg#motion#repeatable#main#make_repeatable({
                        \        'mode':    '',
                        \        'buffer':  0,
                        \        'from':    expand('<sfile>:p').':'.expand('<slnum>'),
                        \        'motions': [
                        \                     { 'bwd': '[M',  'fwd': ']M',  'axis': 1 },
                        \                     { 'bwd': '[m',  'fwd': ']m',  'axis': 1 },

                                        *E8000*

The dictionary argument you passed to `lg#motion#repeatable#main#make()` should
contain the following keys:

    • 'axis'
    • 'buffer'
    • 'from'
    • 'mode'
    • 'motions'

At least one of them is missing.


                                        *E8001*

You asked  for a local motion  to be made  repeatable: both its {lhs}  should be
used in local mappings. But here, at least one of them is not.


                                        *E8002*

Either the motion you're trying to make repeatable (M), is already repeatable:

                               “total collision”

Or, a motion in a database of repeatable motions (global or local) has:

    • the same mode as (M)
    • the same scope as (M)
    • one of its {lhs} is identical to one of (M)

                              “partial collision”

 axis

         Repeatable motions can be repeated with different keys.
         Each group  of motions which  can be repeated  with the same  keys move
         along the same axis.


 database (db)

         dictionary `[s:|b:]repeatable_motions`

         Contains the information relative to all repeatable motions.


 motion

         dictionary containing 2 keys:

             • bwd:     output of `maparg('<left>')` where <left> is
                        the backward motion

             • fwd:     same thing for `<right>` as the forward motion
